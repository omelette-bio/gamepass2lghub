# gamepass2lghub
project to automate the process of adding a gamepass game to lghub (hope that this will become obsolete)

the project works with the terminal just type python3 main.py, for the paths, dont put double quotes or \\, it normally converts it automatically, i will do some adjustements and more security checks but this works just fine
